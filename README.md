# CakePHP Notification Plugin

The **Notification** plugin provides support for sending notifications across a variety of delivery channels, including email, SMS, Telegram, RocketChat, Slack, and Webhooks. Notifications may also be stored in a database so they may be displayed in your web interface.

Typically, notifications are short, informational messages that notify users of something that occurred in your application. The plugin integrates seamlessly with CakePHP's event system and provides a fluent API for building and sending notifications through multiple channels simultaneously.

The plugin includes support for queueing notifications, on-demand notifications, localization, custom channels, and comprehensive testing utilities. It works with CakePHP's behavior system and includes command line tools for managing notifications.
